        <h2 class="contentHeader">Time for some FAQs</h2>
        <p style="font-family:Segoe UI">
        <h3 style="font-family:Segoe UI">What is vaccination? </h3>
        <p style="font-family:Segoe UI">Vaccination is a simple, safe, and effective way of
            protecting people against harmful diseases, before they come
            into contact with them. It uses your body’s natural defenses
            to build resistance to specific infections and makes your
            immune system stronger.</p>
        <h3 style="font-family:Segoe UI">How is the vaccine given?</h3>
        <p style="font-family:Segoe UI">Both vaccines are injected into a muscle (“intramuscular”).
            Intramuscular vaccines are usually injected into the
            shoulder
            muscle called the deltoid. </p>
        <h3 style="font-family:Segoe UI">How many shots do I have to get?</h3>
        <p style="font-family:Segoe UI">Both the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and the Moderna COVID-19
            vaccine , require two doses. The interval (or, spacing)
            between the Pfizer vaccine dose 1 and dose 2 is 21 days. The
            interval (or, spacing) between the Moderna vaccine, dose 1
            and dose 2 is 28 days. </p>
        <h3 style="font-family:Segoe UI">How long will protection last?</h3>
        <p style="font-family:Segoe UI">It is not yet known how long a person who gets the vaccine
            will be protected: it could be lifetime, like the polio
            vaccine
            or it could be a year, like the flu shot. Experts are
            studying this to learn more, and we will share new evidence
            as it
            becomes available.</p>
        <h3 style="font-family:Segoe UI">Will there be enough vaccine for everyone?</h3>
        <p style="font-family:Segoe UI">Yes, eventually. Initial vaccine supply will be limited so
            not everyone will be able to be vaccinated right away.
            COVID-19
            vaccine will be given to people at highest risk first. Based
            on the recommendations from the National Academies of
            Sciences, Engineering and Medicine’s Framework for Equitable
            Allocation of COVID-19 Vaccine, a phased and equitable
            distribution plan has been developed for New Hampshire.
        </p>
        <h3 style="font-family:Segoe UI">When will I get the COVID vaccine?</h3>
        <p style="font-family:Segoe UI">As we reported in January, when you will get the vaccine
            depends on your age and what you do for a living. It also
            matters where you live; New Jersey, for instance, started
            letting anyone with medical risk factors get vaccinated,
            while Los Angeles County stuck to a more restrictive tiered
            system. Some areas offered extra vaccine doses on a
            first-come, first-served basis, while others ran out.</p>
        <h3 style="font-family:Segoe UI">Why should I get vaccinated?</h3>
        <p style="font-family:Segoe UI">Two key reasons to get vaccinated are to protect ourselves
            and to protect those around us. Because not everyone can be
            vaccinated – including very young babies, those who are
            seriously ill or have certain allergies – they depend on
            others being vaccinated to ensure they are also safe from
            vaccine-preventable diseases.</p>
        <h3 style="font-family:Segoe UI">How are vaccines developed and tested?</h3>
        <p style="font-family:Segoe UI">The most commonly used vaccines have been around for decades,
            with millions of people receiving them safely every year. As
            with all medicines, every vaccine must go through extensive
            and rigorous testing to ensure it is safe before it can be
            introduced in a country.

            An experimental vaccine is first tested in animals to
            evaluate its safety and potential to prevent disease. It is
            then tested in human clinical trials, in three phases</p>
        <h3 style="font-family:Segoe UI">Are vaccines safe?</h3>
        <p style="font-family:Segoe UI">Vaccination is safe and side effects from a vaccine are
            usually minor and temporary, such as a sore arm or mild
            fever. More serious side effects are possible, but extremely
            rare.

            Any licensed vaccine is rigorously tested across multiple
            phases of trials before it is approved for use, and
            regularly reassessed once it is introduced. Scientists are
            also constantly monitoring information from several sources
            for any sign that a vaccine may cause health risks.</p>
        <h3 style="font-family:Segoe UI">Are there side effects from vaccines?</h3>
        <p style="font-family:Segoe UI">Like any medicine, vaccines can cause mild side effects, such
            as a low-grade fever, or pain or redness at the injection
            site. Mild reactions go away within a few days on their own.

            Severe or long-lasting side effects are extremely rare.
            Vaccines are continually monitored for safety, to detect
            rare adverse events.</p>
        <h3 style="font-family:Segoe UI">Is it mandatory to take
            the vaccine?</h3>
        <p style="font-family:Segoe UI">Vaccination for COVID-19 is voluntary.
            However, it is advisable to receive the complete
            schedule of COVID-19 vaccine for protecting
            one-self against this disease and also to limit
            the spread of this disease to the close contacts
            including family members, friends, relatives
            and co-workers.</p>
        <h3 style="font-family:Segoe UI"> Will the vaccine
            introduced in India be
            as effective as the
            ones introduced in
            other countries? </h3>
        <p style="font-family:Segoe UI">Yes. The COVID 19 vaccine introduced in India
            will be as effective as any vaccine developed by
            other countries. Various phases of vaccine trials
            are undertaken to ensure its safety and
            efficacy. </p>
        <h3 style="font-family:Segoe UI"> If one is taking
            medicines for
            illnesses like Cancer,
            Diabetes,
            Hypertension etc, can
            s/he take the COVID19 vaccine? </h3>
        <p style="font-family:Segoe UI"> Yes. Persons with one or more of these
            comorbid conditions are considered high risk
            category. They need to get COVID -19
            vaccination.
        </p>
        <h3 style="font-family:Segoe UI">When would
            antibodies develop?
            After taking first dose,
            after taking second
            dose, or much later?</h3>
        <p style="font-family:Segoe UI">Protective levels of antibodies are generally
            developed two weeks after receiving the 2nd
            dose of COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
        <h3 style="font-family:Segoe UI">Who can’t get the vaccine?</h3>
        <p style="font-family:Segoe UI"> Children and adolescents under age 16 are
            not eligible to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech
            vaccine. Those under age 19 are not
            eligible to receive the Moderna vaccine
            as there are not data on the safety and
            efficacy in this population. While pregnant
            or immunocompromised individuals were
            also not included in the first round of trials,
            patients who are pregnant, lactating, or
            immunocompromised are able to determine
            if they wish to receive the vaccine. These
            patients are encouraged to have a
            discussion on the potential benefits and
            risks with their family physician.
            As with other vaccines, anyone who has a
            fever or other symptoms may not be able to
            get the vaccine until their symptoms resolve.
            This includes those who have symptoms or
            are positive for COVID-19. There is also caution
            for people with documented anaphylactic
            reactions to vaccines. Individuals with a known
            allergy to any of the vaccine components
            should not be immunized. </p>
        <h3>I had COVID-19. Should I still be vaccinated? </h3>
        <p> Yes. Unless you are currently actively infected with
            COVID-19, you should get the vaccine. Studies have shown
            that some
            individuals can get the disease more than once. However, if
            you were treated for COVID-19 symptoms with monoclonal
            antibodies or convalescent plasma, you should wait 90 days
            before getting a COVID-19 vaccine.
        </p>
